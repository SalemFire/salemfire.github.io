            <p>A "plus money" story


These days on a business trip, but also because of business travel Aunt Zhang turned down a public test, very sad, together with the love of the war days in the wilderness of their own, ready to pull the recent pull of a grass.

The original goal is the following red and black clay figurines of this Casio, the characteristics of oil-resistant mud is very suiwatch for my daily life, there are prices close to the people, the number is large enough, the dial is not particularly great, etc. Let me heart characteristics:
CASIO Casio GW-9400-1 male models wave <a href="http://www.mmwatches.co.uk" title="swiss replica watches">swiss replica watches</a>
: cat people? Mountain people? Rangers? G-SHOCK The famous clay figurine series, the appearance of tough, designed for people who love locomotives designed and developed, anti-mud structure to put an end to all from the oil environment and dust-laden car rally game erosion, Double-lit electronic lighting for 3 to 5 seconds of flashing to ensure that reading in the dark. Anti-low temperature, anti-mud, anti-magnetic, shockproof, 200 meters waterproof, dual display electronic fluorescent lighting, automatic backlight, stopwatch (accurate to 1/100 second Amazon direct link



GW-9400-1, this watch also has a single station in the station, in general, is Casio in the previous MASTER of G series of cross-border new products, the main push for the first time in the series deployed triple sensor (temperature, pressure, . Named on the continuation of the same series of watches, "the word generation" rule, composed of five members of a series:


"RANGEMAN" the name of the mainstream in the country is called "mountain" and "cat people", both of which may be derived from the case back of the Bobcats pattern, but may also come from the word "Ranger" "Ranger" This layer of meaning, of course, Ranger can also be used as "slutters".

Speaking of back shell, in addition to trimming cut hands outside, MASTER of G series on the back of the LOGO group hidden a lot of information. Such as clay figurine MUDMAN series logo, in addition to Anniversary Edition, the main body is a mole, old clay figurine driving, the new clay figurine walk, holding the radio antenna is the radio version, the hands of the compass is Wave-free version

The GW9400, is said to be the mascot on the back of the Bobcats, three nail claws on behalf of the "triple sensor", the wrist of the compass means electronic compass, which ... some say repeat. Of course, as the first equipped with a triple sensor master series, the six Bureau of radio is essential, but not in the Bobcats who tied a radio wave antenna, because do not want too Meng CASIO CASIO GW-9400-1 male models Radio watch: Cat people? Mountain people? Rangers?


Two buttons on the left is the <a href="http://www.bestukwatches.co.uk" title="replica watches uk">replica watches uk</a>
 middle of the sensor openings, air intake structure to increase the feeling of the area while providing protection to maintain the master series has always been tough style. Button to take a different from the previous structure, the trigger pressure is very small, and can rotate 360 ​​°. At first I was also disturbed that this will not bring "loose" feeling, the results proved worrying.

Familiar with the master series of friends will find in the RANGEMAN almost can find the master of the various series of design elements: RANGEMAN sensor on the left side of the clay figurine series, the right side of the B button is almost copied the trapeze series design, the bottom of the light keys and the Bay Man Position, like, the dial in the circle is inherited from the frogman series. It is no wonder that the wind that GW9400 is a set of four director of a cross-border new products, which makes me somewhat psychological comfort.

Daily functions


Function I will not enumerate, and a friend in need Casio official website to download the corresponding movement (3410) electronic version of the manual, which describes the very detailed. Here I lazy fight a map - the naming rules of the button from the bottom right up, right side in order of "A, B, C", the left side up to "D, E", light keys called "L ". First of all, in addition to the general function of the sensor outside the profile, press the D key to switch:

CASIO Casio GW-9400-1 male models wave watch: cat people? Mountain people? Rangers?

The general setting is in the time mode, press the E key to enter, the function is set in the corresponding screen long press E key, not one by one. It is worth mentioning that in any screen, long press D key to return to time mode, which is very convenient.



The following is a triple sensor puzzle, any mode, press the right middle of the B key to enter the sensor mode, then press B to switch the sensor mode, namely: temperature + air pressure mode, altitude mode, electronic compass mode -

Height measurement function

First of all, need to detoxify the altimeter function, and other models, GW9400 using the pressure conversion height information, that is, with the barometric pressure sensor measured the current air pressure, according to the corresponding altitude of the general conversion formula to obtain the data. The height information obtained in this way only in a few contexts have reference significance.

Although the height of the baseline information allows users to query the current altitude information to the calibration, the weather changes instantly lose meaning, the following me I can think of a high degree of information meaningless loss of several factors:

Hourly changes in weather, seasonal, latitude, climate, topography, wind, indoor and outdoor

As long as the above-mentioned situation occurs, which rely on high pressure information will be lost reference value, I would like to mention here.


Electronic compass

Electronic compass has always been a great feature in the master series, set aside extremely vulnerable to the impact of the surrounding magnetic field this, the hands have a fear of no electricity, can be calibrated at any time when the electronic compass in the travel heart is at ease.

And before the clay figurative electronic compass different, RANGEMAN dial without "N, S, W, E" words, but in the display of electronic compass with three thick lines that magnetic north, the other direction can only rely on their brains. Note that the watch is measured in the direction of 12 o'clock and the magnetic north of the angle, which is not marked on the dial, the beginning I foolishly think that the right side of the B key is where the red arrow measurement azimuth, almost poked the basket ... ...

Temperature + air pressure

This is not to say, the pressure is very sensitive, blowing the wind can see the changes, real-time monitoring. If in the outdoors, then can be based on sudden changes in air pressure to alert extreme weather.

Because the temperature is worn on the hand, unless the pick-up for a while or else can only play a role in monitoring the temperature of the wrist (seems quite useful)

Speaking of temperature, have to say, the lowest temperature range -10 ℃ for the usefulness of this watch greatly reduced.

North winter, the lowest only -10 ℃, funny CASIO Casio GW-9400-1 male models wave watch: cat people? Mountain people? Rangers?
