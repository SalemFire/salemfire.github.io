					<p align="justify">Salem Fire Department not only provided 
					fire protection to the residents of the Salem and Mull communities, but 
					to the neighboring Enola community as well. However, in late 
					1980, the department discontinued services to Enola, citing 
					rising fuel and equipment costs and lack of fire tax 
					dollars. The Enola Fire Department was later formed to serve 
					that area.</p>
					<p align="justify">The Salem Fire Department has responded 
					to many incidents throughout its history, however there are 
					a few large incidents that will always be remembered. One of 
					those was the High Peak Mountain fire in April 1985. This 
					was one of the largest wildland fires in Burke County 
					history. All of the local emergency organizations as well as 
					several outside agencies provided equipment and manpower, 
					including Salem.</p>
					<p align="justify">
					<img border="0" src="st2const.jpg" width="320" height="219" align="left" hspace="21">As the demand for more fire services and 
					the call volume increased, as well as an increase in the 
					protection district in which Salem served, the department 
					decided to add a substation. In 1986, after several months 
					of hard work and dedication from the firefighters and their 
					families, Salem Fire Department Station 2 was opened. Also 
					in 1986, the department began providing medical response 
					services with First Responders. Members were trained in 
					emergency medical procedures and provided first-line 
					treatment and stabilization to residents prior to the 
					arrival of the county's EMS ambulances.</p>
					<p align="justify">In March 1987, Salem Fire Department 
					responded to another large incident that will not be 
					forgotten, and this time it hit close to home. The Salem 
					Junior High School, which sits adjacent to the department's 
					Station 1, was destroyed by an explosion and fire. The 
					explosion was heard and felt for several miles. The 
					department was conducting a training scenario at the time 
					not far from the station and initiated response even before 
					they were dispatched.</p>
					<p align="justify">As the population grew and traffic 
					increased in the community, the occurrences of vehicle 
					crashes involving trapped victims also grew. Rescue services 
					were stationed several miles away and therefore often had a 
					lengthy response time. Since the fire department was 
					responding to those incidents anyway, it was felt that 
					providing rescue services would be a good idea. In 1991, the 
					department began providing extrication services to the 
					community and our name was changed to Salem Fire &amp; Rescue, 
					along with a change in the department's patch.</p>
					<p align="justify">In 2002, the department took another 
					major step by hiring a full-time career Fire Chief. The 
					department felt that the increasing requirements and 
					responsibilities of a Chief were just too demanding for 
					volunteering, and due to the current Fire Chief retiring, 
					decided this was the perfect time to move forward.</p>
					<p align="justify">Currently, the department Chief serves on 
					a volunteer basis. Also, the department has several members 
					who work part-time as Duty Officers, on duty Monday through 
					Friday 8AM to 4PM.</p>

					<img border="0" src="old_patch.GIF" width="135" height="149" align="left" hspace="21">As with most local fire departments, 
					Salem Fire &amp; Rescue was formed from the needs and necessity 
					of the local community. Up until the late 1960s, the City of 
					Morganton Fire Department provided fire protection to most 
					of the neighboring communities, including Salem. At that 
					time, the City of Morganton decided to discontinue providing 
					fire services outside the city limits. Then, in 1970, the 
					residents of the Salem community met and decided to organize 
					their own fire department. On February 24, 1971 the department 
					received its charter, and the Salem Fire Department was 
					established.<img border="0" src="earlyfd.jpg" width="320" height="256" align="left" hspace="21" style="float: right"></p>
					<p align="justify">
					</p>
				<p align="justify">Our newly formed department started with 
					a small two-bay building and only one apparatus, a 1971 American-LaFrance 1000 GPM pumper. 
					Then in 1972, the department purchased a 1958 Ford oil truck 
					and converted it into an 1100 gallon tanker. Throughout the 
					years and as the needs have grown, the department has 
					acquired several pieces of apparatus and currently has eight 
					apparatus in service.</p>
				<p align="justify">In 1973, the ladies auxiliary was formed 
					to provide assistance to the firefighters, department and 
					community. The initial loan for the building and first three 
					apparatus were paid for in 1975, only four years from the 
					beginnings of the department!</p>
				<p align="justify">The small two-bay building was later 
					expanded to include a kitchen area for the firefighters' use 
					and for fundraisers. As the community continued to grow, so 
					did the fire department. The building was again expanded to 
					include an upstairs meeting/training room and office and a 
					third drive-thru bay was added to the two existing bays.</p> </font></div>
