Read our information pamphlet<p>WATCH INSTRUCTIONS AND INFORMATION</p><p>Warning:</p><p>This watch is water resistant not water proof You cannot submerge your watch in water and you should remove it before taking a shower</p><p>Understanding your watch:</p><p>The Crown: The crown is the main dial or knob on your watch It is the biggest and the center one to the right It is used to set and wind your watch</p><p>The crown has 4 positions:</p><p>Position 1: Closed- When you receive your watch the crown will be in the closed position Once you have opened the crown you need to press the crown inwards and turn it clockwise to screw it back into the closed position <a href="http://slearning.mosystems.net/infos/7098-replica-richard-mille-rm-057-tourbillon-dragon-jackie-chan-silver-case-black-rubber-bracelet-1454201.html">Replica Richard Mille RM 057 Tourbillon Dragon Jackie Chan Silver Case Black Rubber Bracelet 1454201</a> It is always advisable to keep the crown tightly closed when you are not adjusting the date or time</p><p>Position 2: Winding- Starting with the watch in the closed position, if you turn the crown counter-clockwise the knob will unscrew, once unscrewed it will pop out <a href="http://prodriverlawyer.com/info/7102-replica-roger-vivier-prismick-3d-black-and-white-606884.html">Replica Roger Vivier Prismick 3D Black and White 606884</a> This initial position is for winding Always wind in a clockwise direction (away from your body) Winding counter clockwise can damage your watch</p><p>Position 3: Date-Starting with the crown in position 2 gently nudge the dial outwards by pulling with your thumb and forefinger It is important to note that pulling it all the way out will move it to position 4 You need to find the sweet spot between position 2 and 4 to change the date If your watch does not display the date there will be no position 3 When the crown is in the date position it is very important that you do not force it counter clockwise You can damage the mechanism</p><p>Position 4: Time- Starting from either position 2 or 3, with your thumb and forefinger pull the crown out until it stops From this final position you can change the time Always move the crown in a clockwise direction Moving the dial counter clockwise can damage the mechanism</p><p>*Some watches (Hublot &amp; Cartier) have 4 different dials or knobs that are used for setting the date and time <a href="http://dawgsled.com/upload/7105-replica-rolex-bamford-submariner-black-dial-roman-numerals-black-ionized-case-and-bracelet.html">Replica Rolex Bamford Submariner Black Dial Roman Numerals Black Ionized Case And Bracelet</a></p><p>Operating Instructions:</p><p>Winding your watch: When you first receive your automatic watch you will need to manually wind it for approximately 1 minute <a href="http://beingrandom.com/lists/7099-replica-richard-mille-rm-35-01-rafael-nadal-gold-case-black-rubber-bracelet-1454197.html">Replica Richard Mille RM 35-01 Rafael Nadal Gold Case Black Rubber Bracelet 1454197</a> This is what we call ‘jumpstarting’ your watch From position 2 turn the dial clockwise for 3 consecutive minutes Do not turn the dial counter clockwise You could damage the mechanism.</p><p>To ensure your watch is fully wound we recommend also winding it by 2 full clockwise circles 3 times a day for the following 2 to 3 days After that your watch will continue to self-wind from the motion of your wrist provided you continue to wear it every day.</p><p>Setting the Time: While the crown is in position 4 turn the dial clockwise (away from your body) until the hands have reached the correct position Do not turn the dial counter-clockwise You could damage the mechanism.</p><p>Setting the Date: With the crown in position 3 turn the dial clockwise (away from your body) to change the date If your watch also displays the day you may be able to turn the dial counter clockwise to change the day Do not force it; if your watch does not have this functionality you could damage your watch by turning the dial counter clockwise</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chronographs: Many of our watch models feature up to 3 sub-dials These are chronographs (essentially stop watches) with timekeeping intervals ranging from seconds to hours The chronographs are activated with start/stop push buttons located next to the crown To start a chronograph, simply push the button corresponding to that sub-dial, and press the same button again to stop it</p><p>How is your watch powered?</p><p>Kinetic Watch: Your kinetic watch does not use a battery <a href="http://travelingtails.net/info/7101-replica-richard-mille-turbillion-spider-rm-19-01-black-case-black-rubber-bracelet-1454257.html">Replica Richard Mille Turbillion Spider RM 19-01 Black Case Black Rubber Bracelet 1454257</a> Inside the face of the watch there is a small mallet which self-winds the watch according to the movement of your hand If you take the watch off for more than 24 hours you may have to reset the watch and wind it.</p><p>Quartz Watch: A quartz watch is powered by a battery The battery will need to be replaced regularly in order to keep your watch in working order</p><p>Japanese vs <a href="https://www.hbags.ru/">hbags</a> Swiss Watches:</p><p>The materials that are used for the casing, bracelet, and exterior features of both types of watch are the same The only difference is in the precision of the manufacturing Some exterior details may be closer to the original and the exterior features of the watch may be more exact on the Swiss models<br>Swiss quality watches are made with Swiss ETA movement and are actually made in Switzerland They are identical to the original in every way <a href="http://megadatasys.com/infos/7106-rolex-black-leather-with-rose-gold-clasp-bracelet-622498-rolex-watches-bracelets.html">Rolex Black Leather with Rose Gold Clasp Bracelet 622498 Rolex Watches Bracelets</a> Japanese quality watches are made with Miyota movement This mechanism can sometimes be less precise.<br>It is also common on Japanese quality watches that some of the functionality is for show only <a href="https://www.hbags.ru/">handbags fake</a> By contrast, all the functionality of the Swiss watches is fully operational The power reserve on the Swiss watches is better so it will need to be wound less</p><p>Trouble Shooting:</p><p>Your Watch Stops Working: Your automatic watch does not use a battery and winds itself using the movement of your wrist It is normal for a watch to stop after 24-48 hours of not being worn You will need to wind your watch and reset the time as outlined in this pamphlet It will then automatically wind itself once you start wearing it again</p><p>Your Watch is Losing Or Gaining Time: If your Automatic watch is losing or gaining time in a 24-hour period, while you are wearing it, the watch movement needs to be adjusted All of our automatic watches feature Japanese Miyota or Swiss ETA movements with an adjustment screw just like the original Any local jeweler can easily service these watches</p><p>Chronograph Doesn’t Work: Our Swiss watches have fully functional chronographs just like the originals <a href="http://svcolt.org/htmls/7107-replica-rolex-cellini-black-dial-gold-case-black-leather-strap-622832.html">Replica Rolex Cellini Black Dial Gold Case Black Leather Strap 622832</a> If one of the chronographs stops working it needs to be serviced by a professional Servicing a chronograph involves removing the case and manually restarting or replacing the mechanism that controls it<br>Unfortunately many Japanese made watches do not have the separate mechanism necessary to operate multi-function chronographs If you wish to have fully functional chronographs we recommend you purchase a Swiss quality watch <a href="http://venusiian.com/infos/7103-replica-roger-vivier-prismick-3d-white-and-yellow-606884.html">Replica Roger Vivier Prismick 3D White and Yellow 606884</a></p><p>Battery Powered Watch Does Not Work</p><p>If your watch is not fully operational when you receive it, it may be necessary to remove and replace the battery of your watch to restart it</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We recommend having your watch serviced once or twice a year to ensure the mechanism continues to work</p><p>&nbsp;</p></li></ul>Related Products<ul><li>Rolex Yacht-Master-rl102<br>$199.00</li><li>Swiss Rolex Day Date Diamond
